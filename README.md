# guavacachetest02
This is a simple test program using [Google Guava](https://github.com/google/guava) caches. The code is currently in [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) format so you will need to import the project into Eclipse. You can do this by doing *File->Import* then under *General->Existing Projects into workspace*

We need [Google Guava](https://github.com/google/guava) and [sqlite-jdbc](https://bitbucket.org/xerial/sqlite-jdbc).
The necessary jars are included in the repo, so these will need to be updated if there are newer versions available. I'm thinking about moving this to Maven or Gradle so that the dependecies are better handled.
